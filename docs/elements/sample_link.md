_'A unique identifier to assign parent-child subsample or sibling samples. This is relevant when a sample or other material was used to generate the new sample. This field allows multiple entries separated by ; (Examples: Soil collected from the field will link with the soil used in an incubation. The soil a plant was grown in links to the plant sample. An original culture sample was transferred to a new vial and generated a new sample)'_
